            <p>
                Hi, I'm HolyChowders.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a Madison-based Software Engineering student interested in medical science/engineering and embedded systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                My ultimate goal is that of significantly improving the lives of individuals through biological and technological innovation. I wish to make a great impact on the world by solving difficult and important problems and to lift up and inspire everyone around me on my journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                I see myself as an engineer. I don't believe that the world's problems are someone else's to solve. I find myself dissatisfied when I see a problem left not only unsolved, but poorly defined. I believe that problems exist to be solved, not shrugged off as mere facts of life.
            </p>
